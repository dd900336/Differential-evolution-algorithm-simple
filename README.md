# Differential-evolution-algorithm-simple

**A simple C++ code for practice DE**

Differential evolution algorithmï¼š
  1. Stochastic, population-based optimisation algorithm
  2. Global optimization is necessary in fields such as engineering, statistics and finance
  3. But many practical problems have objective functions that are non- differentiable, non-continuous, non-linear, noisy,          flat, multi-dimensional or have many local minima, constraints or stochasticity
  4. DE can be used to find approximate solutions to such problems
